This used to make use of the Google library, `geocoder`, to get lat/long coordinates which were then used as input 
for the Wikipedia Places API. The output would be a list of places within walking distance of the address
specified in the search bar.
However, Google now requires a registered API key be submitted with every query. If you have one, you can 
plug it into the code and check it out for yourself :D
